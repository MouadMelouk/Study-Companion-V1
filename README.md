# Study-Companion-V1
This is a simple app designed for the M5Core2 device that helps users stay focused during study and work sessions and encourages physical activity breaks. It utilizes the device's gyroscope and accelerometer to detect shaking motion and measure stretching angles.

Features
Focus Session Mode: Set a desired focus time and receive alerts if no shaking motion is detected within that time.
Stretching Session Mode: Attach the device and measure stretching angles, tracking your progress and high scores.

Installation
Install the following libraries: M5Core2, SPIFFS, and EEPROM.
Upload the code to the M5Core2 device.

Usage
Calibrate the shaking motion and set up the app following the on-screen instructions.
Start a focus session by pressing the leftmost button or switch to the stretching session by pressing the rightmost button.
Follow the instructions for each session and interact with the device accordingly.
At the end of each session, choose to start another focus session or continue with stretching as desired.

Future Improvements
Integration with a mobile app for enhanced session tracking and analysis.
Customizable vibration thresholds and stretching goals.
Gamification elements to make the experience more engaging.
Feel free to customize and expand upon this app according to your specific needs and preferences.
